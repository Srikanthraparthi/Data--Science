Steps to Create an SMS Classifier:
1. Data Preparation:
Dataset Collection: Obtain a dataset containing SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.
Data Cleaning: Remove any unnecessary characters, punctuation, and perform basic text cleaning.
2. Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase for consistency.
Removing Stopwords: Eliminate common words that may not carry significant meaning.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form for normalization.
3. Feature Engineering:
Vectorization: Transform text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words. This converts the text data into a format that machine learning models can understand.
4. Model Building:
Select a Classifier: Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) to train and classify the SMS messages.
Train the Model: Use the labeled SMS dataset to train the classifier on the features extracted earlier.
5. Model Evaluation:
Test the Model: Assess the classifier's performance using a separate set of SMS messages not seen during training.
Metrics Evaluation: Measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate how well the model predicts spam and ham messages.
6. Deployment:
Once the model performs well, it can be deployed to classify new, unseen SMS messages.
